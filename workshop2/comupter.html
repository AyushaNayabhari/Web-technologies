    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <h2>History of computer</h2>
    
    <p><blockquote><b>Computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.</b></blockquote>  These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

       <p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>

    <p>The evolution of computer technology is often divided into five generations.
        <ul>
            
                <li>First generation	1940s-1950s	Vacuum tube based
                </li>
                <li>Second generation	1950s-1960s	Transistor based
                </li>
                <li>Third generation	1960s-1970s	Integrated circuit based</li>
                <li>Fourth generation	1970s-present	Microprocessor based</li>
                <li>Fifth generation	The present and the future	Artificial intelligence based</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>The main characteristics of first generation of computers (1940s-1950s)</b></h3>
    <img src="1.jpg" height="250px" width="350px">
    <ul>
    <li>Main electronic component -vacuum tube</li>
    <li>Main memory – magnetic drums and magnetic tapes</li>
        <li>Programming language – machine language</li>
            <li>Power – consume a lot of electricity and generate a lot of heat.</li>
                <li>Speed and size – very slow and very large in size (often taking up entire room).</li>
                    <li>Input/output devices – punched cards and paper tape.</li>
                        <li>Examples – ENIAC, UNIVAC1, IBM 650, IBM 701, etc.</li>
                            <li>Quantity – there were about 100 different vacuum tube computers produced between 1942 and1963.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Second Generation of Computers</b></h3>
<img src="2.jpg" height="250px" width="350px">
<ul>
    <li>
        Main electronic component – transistor</li>
    <li>Memory – magnetic core and magnetic tape / disk</li>
    <li>Programming language – assembly language</li>
    <li>Power and size – low power consumption, generated less heat, and smaller in size (in comparison with the first generation computers).</li>
    <li>Input/output devices – punched cards and magnetic tape.</li>
    
</ul>
<h3><b>Third Generation of Computers</b></h3>
<img src="3.jpg" height="250px" width="350px">
<ul>
    <li>
        Main electronic component – integrated circuits (ICs)</li>
    <li>Memory – large magnetic core, magnetic tape / disk</li>
    <li>Programming language – high level language (FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, COBOL, C, etc.)</li>
    <li>Size – smaller, cheaper, and more efficient than second generation computers (they were called minicomputers).</li>
    <li>Input / output devices – magnetic tape, keyboard, monitor, printer, etc.</li>
    
</ul>
    

<h3><b>Fourth Generation of Computers</b></h3>
<img src="4.jpeg" height="250px" width="350px">
<ul>
    <li>
        Main electronic component – very large-scale integration (VLSI) and microprocessor.</li>
    <li>VLSI– thousands of transistors on a single microchip.</li>
    <li>Programming language – high level language (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, etc.).</li>
    
</ul>
<h3><b>Fifth Generation of Computers</b></h3>
<img src="5.jpg" height="250px" width="350px">
<ul>
    <li>
        Main electronic component: based on artificial intelligence, uses the Ultra Large-Scale Integration (ULSI) technology and parallel processing method..</li>
    <li>Language – understand natural language (human language).</li>
    <li>Speed – remarkable improvement of speed, accuracy and reliability (in comparison with the fourth generation computers).</li>
</ul>
